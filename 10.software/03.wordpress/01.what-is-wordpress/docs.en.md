!!! If you have to ask this question then maybe our service is not for you. **StackHost.io** is "developers only" hosting provider.

But for the sake of learning here is a quick crash course.

### Overview of WordPress

WordPress is a free and open source content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL. WordPress is installed on a web server, which either is part of an internet hosting service or is a network host itself; the first case may be on a service like WordPress.com, for example, and the second case is a computer running the software package WordPress.org.

WordPress is considered the easiest to use CMS thanks to a user-friendly interface. It also has an amazing number of plugins which allow extension of its functionality in many ways. 

### Dedicated WordPress Hosting 

StackHost's Dedicated WordPress Hosting is a solid platform that is optimised for speed, security and reliability.​​​​​

The Wordpress platform is still Linux based but only hosts Wordpress sites. It's optimised for WordPress, and uses our StackCache plugin. StackCache was developed in-house to provide the most efficient way of managing multiple caching layers, whilst still giving complete control over our edge cache systems from a familiar admin interface.

### WordPress.com vs. WordPress.org

It's important to note the differences between WordPress.com and WordPress.org as they're considered to be separate platforms.

WordPress.com provides a more hands-off approach to developing a site. After registering for an account you can select a theme, add and manage content through parameters set by WordPress and proceed to add plugins to produce more dynamic content to your site. This service is ideal for bloggers, photographers, artists, plumbers, doctors, restaurateurs or anyone else who is happy running a generic site that displays content to its visitors. The primary drawback to WordPress.com is the inability to edit code or maintain full control over the site. Therefore, it's considered more suitable for less technical users.

WordPress.org is the self-hosted platform that allows complete control over the code so you can implement any theme, modify it entirely, or create your own. You can add any plugin you want, and then hack the code. The application's code is completely open, allowing you total access to modify, tweak, or explore what you want. With WordPress.org you can create a website that functions the exact way you want.
