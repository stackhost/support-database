Our WordPress platform is optimised just for WordPress. We've developed our own custom plugin - **StackCache** - that controls our edge caching tech. 

Due to this, we don't allow any other software to run on our Wordpress platform and vice vers. The platform's nature means there are a few restrictions compared to our standard developer hosting platforms. While we do support both additional domain names and subdomains on this platform, they must be configured to point to the same WordPress installation - and hence should then be managed through a WordPress Network.
