!!! If you have to ask this question then maybe our service is not for you. **StackHost.io** is "developers only" hosting provider.

But for the sake of learning here are a few facts about Joomla.

Joomla! is a free, open source Content Management System (CMS) used for publishing web content. 

The Joomla! web CMS is considered to be a popular choice for many types of websites, including corporate sites, news or blogs, government applications, small business sites and sites where secure logins are required. The ecosystem of Joomla! developers and users provide products and services to the Joomla! community which has more than half a million members and more than 20,000 developers.

The Joomla! control panel is used to give a main overview for page navigation to site control and content creation.

The control panel is where you can:

* Create articles, categories, weblinks, modules and menus.
* Manage articles, categories, components, modules, templates, plugins, and menus
* Install templates, components, plugins, and modules
* Upload files such as images with the media manager
* Update Joomla core software and installed templates, plugins, components and modules.

! What WordPress calls 'plugins', Joomla! calls 'extensions'. Joomla! offers over 6000 extensions under the categories: components, modules, plugins, templates, and languages.
