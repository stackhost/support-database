!!! If you have to ask this question then maybe our service is not for you. **StackHost.io** is "developers only" hosting provider.

But for the sake of learning here are a few quick points about Apache.

! Apache - short for Apache HTTP server - is a web server application.

!!! Apache handles the delivery of content on web servers that can be accessed over the internet. This content could include HTML documents, multimedia such as images or video, CSS
!!! scripts and client-side scripts such as JavaScript.

!!!! Apache is currently the most widely used web server software because it offers some key benefits. Apache is very robust, meaning it is able to handle a high volume of traffic on a !!!! single server and is able to server multiple different varieties of content types with minimal configuration. Also, the ability to naturally scale enables Apache to serve small !!!! static websites to large enterprise applications. 

! Developed and maintained by Apache Software Foundation, Apache is open source software available for free.
