To migrate your emails and mailboxes to StackHost, you can use our in-house Email Migrations tool. This will let you migrate your IMAP mailboxes, your Gmail mailboxes and your Outlook mailboxes into StackCP.

To do this: 

- Login to StackCP
- Select which package you want to migrate emails in to via Manage Hosting.
- Select the Email Migrations tool that is within the emails section.

>>> Please note: you'll need to have set up the mailboxes within StackCP first using the same password as currently used by the mailbox.

!! If the sync fails to start, this is likely due to the credentials not being correct. You should confirm that the password you have used is correct and that the hostname is also correct before requesting support.
