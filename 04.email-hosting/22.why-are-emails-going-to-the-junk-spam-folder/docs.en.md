### Sender ID/SPF

Email being sent to the junk / spam folder can be related to the SenderID or Sender Policy Framework (SPF). We manage an SPF record but it's not added automatically. Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records help reduce the chance of your domain being spoofed in spam messages, and can help increase the deliverability of e-mail to external providers such as Gmail and Outlook.

To add one you can see the guide [Can I add SPF records for my domain?](/email-hosting/can-i-add-spf-records-for-my-domain)
