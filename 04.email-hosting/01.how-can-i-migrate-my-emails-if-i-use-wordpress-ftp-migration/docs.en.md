To do this: 

- Login to [StackCockpit](https://stackcp.com)
- Select which package you want to migrate emails into via Manage Hosting.
- Select the Email Migrations tool that is within the emails section.

>>>>> You will need to have set up the mailboxes within StackHost first using the same password as currently used by the mailbox.

!! If your sync fails to start, this is likely due to the credentials not being correct. You should confirm that the password you have used is correct and that the hostname is also correct.
