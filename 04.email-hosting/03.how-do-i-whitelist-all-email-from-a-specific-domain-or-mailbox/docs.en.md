If you want to allow all emails to be received from a specific sending email address - so that even mails classed as 'junk' will arrive - then you can 'whitelist' this address within Junk Mail Filters within the package. 

- Login to [StackCP](http://stackcp.com)
- Select domain where your mailboxes are located 
- Under **Email** tab click "**Junk Mail Fiters**"
