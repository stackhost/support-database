ImageMagick - the open-source image tool - is supported. We currently run Version 6.7.2. The path to the ImageMagick binary is:

	/usr/bin/convert

Alternatively, some scripts may require just the directory path, in which case please enter:

	/usr/bin

### Imagick PHP Extension

While all customers have access to the convert command line program, unfortunately the PHP extension is not available on our hosting platform.
