We encrypt all FTP, email and database passwords so they are not visible as plain text inside your StackCP control panel.

The exception is the very first FTP account: this password is visible on the right hand side when you manage your hosting. You're able to change all passwords and changes are usually processed immediately.

!!! **Please note:** the majority of database passwords will be saved in the configuration or connection strings for your website.
!!! For WordPress for example, the database password is visible inside the wp-config.php file.
