### Kopage Web Builder
We were going back and forth about including this web builder with our hosting packages. Half of devs said no, the other half (the half that is using Kopage here and there) said yes.
We know that web developers (us included) don't like those things but we believe we found one that actually looks good and produces good websites (and decent code).
Only usable for extra small (and static) projects.

Web Builder is a 3rd party solution called **Kopage**.
