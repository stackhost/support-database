### Free SSL Certificate

We do not sell SSL certificates directly. You can activate your free SSL certificate in your StackCP. Our Free Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates are from **Letâ€™s Encrypt**. These require you to use our nameservers. They help improve Google ranking and reassure potential customers that a site is secure.
