### Free SSL certificate

At StackHost.io we made sure you get free SSL certificate with each and every domain hosted on our servers. Actuall that was one of the pre-requisites when creating StackHost.io.
We wanted quality (not some dodgy SSL) certificates for our developers but we didn't want them to pay arm and a leg for it. So we found a way of giving you a free ssl certificate. Only restriction is that the domain has to be hosted on our servers. Should be easy :)

To manage SSL please login to your StackCP, click on Manage, locate Security tab and lcick on SSL/TLS
