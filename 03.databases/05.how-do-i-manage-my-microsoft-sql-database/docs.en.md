We recommend using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for managing your Microsoft SQL databases. 

This industry-standard software provides a comprehensive environment for Microsoft SQL database creation, access, configuration, development, and other management features. It includes a variety of components including visual database tools, code and text editors, object management, boilerplate text management, and more. With SSMS you can deploy, monitor, and upgrade the data-tier components used by your applications, as well as build queries and scripts.

SSMS also helps you download and back up your MS SQL databases, which we recommend you do at regular intervals in the interests of best practice security.

You can download the software for free on the [Microsoft SSMS download page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).
