At StackHost, each MySQL database you create can store up to 1024 MB (1 GB) of data. As databases comprise only text, this is a lot of space in real terms; to put it into perspective, a StackHost customer’s average database size is just 10 MB.

In the rare event that you need more than 1024 MB, you'll need to add an additional database. You aren't able to add more MySQL databases to websites hosted on our WordPress hosting platform; you will need to complete a Platform Transfer first.

If you have a Business package with us, there’s no limit to the number of additional databases you can add. If you have a Starter Hosting package, you are limited to one MySQL database but you can upgrade your hosting package through StackCockpit (StackCP), or purchase an additional hosting plan.
